Learning how to make games by implementing a small space exploration ship game on top of [pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/)

## Running

For running locally, run `make dev`. You will need `make` and `npm` installed

For production builds, run `make build`

## How to play

Main controls:
* Hold `W` for the ship thruster
* Hold `D` to rotate clockwise
* Hold `A` to rotate counter clockwise
* Press `X` to kill rotation and velocity

On the top left of the screen you will find the ship instruments (in text form for now).
